NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network
      interface. For this procedure to work, networking must be 
      setup first (see networking.howto.txt for details).

      If using PCAP as network interface you need to set up NFS 
      file sharing on your host system or network and replace the 
      server name (shared.local) with the name of your NFS 
      server. You might also need to create an entry with your 
      server's IP address and hostname in "/etc/hosts".


HOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 3.0 and later:

1. Open NFSManager (you find it in the /NextAdmin directory).

2. Go to the Imported Directories window and press "Add...".

3. Set server name to "shared.local" and remote directory to "/".
   Click OK and quit NFSManager. 

4. The shared folder should immediately be accessible from /Net 
   directory.


NOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2:

1. Open the file "/etc/fstab" using this command from the
   command line:
      open /etc/fstab   

2. Edit the file "/etc/fstab" by adding the shared filesystem.
   Add this line at the end of the file: 
      shared.local:/ /Net nfs rw,net 0 0

3. Load the edited file using these commands from the command
   line:
      su
      niload fstab / < /etc/fstab

4. The shared folder should be accessible from /Net directory
   after reboot.


HOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 0.9:

1. Open Shell (you find it in /NextApps directory) and copy the
   files "/etc/fstab" and "/etc/rc" to your home directory using 
   these commands:
      su
      cp /etc/fstab /me
      cp /etc/rc /me

2. Open the file "/me/fstab" and append this line at the end of 
   the file:
      shared.local:/ /Net nfs rw 0 0
   Save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

3. Open the file "/me/rc" and replace the term 
      mount -vat nfs
   with the term
      mount -v shared.local:/ /Net
   Save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

4. Using Shell copy the modified files back in place and reboot:
      su
      cp /me/fstab /etc
      cp /me/rc /etc
      reboot

5. The shared folder should be accessible from /Net directory.


HOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 0.8:

1. Open Shell (you find it in /bootdisk/NeXT/Apps directory) and 
   copy "/etc/fstab" to your home directory using these commands:
      su
      cp /etc/fstab /bootdisk/Homes/me

2. Open the file "/bootdisk/Homes/me/fstab" and append this line
   at the end of the file:
      shared.local:/ /bootdisk/Network nfs rw 0 0
   Save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

3. Using Shell copy the modified file back in place and reboot:
      su
      cp /bootdisk/Homes/me/fstab /etc
      touch /bootdisk/fastboot
      reboot

4. The shared folder should be accessible from /bootdisk/Network
   directory.


HOWTO: Manually mount NFS shared directory:

1. Open Terminal and type these commands to the command line:
      su
      mount -o rw shared.local:/ /Net

2. The shared folder should immediately be accessible from /Net 
   directory.
