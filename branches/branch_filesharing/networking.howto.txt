NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network interface. If 
      using PCAP as network interface, you have to replace your domain and 
      address and the addresses of nameserver, router, broadcast and netmask 
      with values valid on your local network. If your router does not support 
      the Routing Information Protocol version 1 you have to statically 
      configure the router address.


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 and later:

1. On first boot you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might be dropped to 
   the single user mode console. If prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on 
   the single user mode console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open "/etc/resolv.conf" and add these two lines to the file:
      domain local
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

   If the file does not exist, you have to first create it. Make sure you create 
   a plain text file. If using Edit.app select Format > Text > Make ASCII. You 
   can save the file from the save dialog by typing "/etc/resolv.conf" to the 
   name field.

3. Open "/etc/hosts" and append the following lines. In the first line replace 
   xxx with your preferred hostname. It has to consist of a maximum of eight 
   lower case letters.
      10.0.2.15 xxx
      10.0.2.254 nfs

   Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and load the edited file 
   using these commands:
      su
      niload hosts / < /etc/hosts 

4. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextAdmin directory).

   Go to "Local..." and configure with these values:
   a  For "Network Type" select  "Non-NetInfo Network"
   b  For "Yellow Pages Domain Name" select "None"
   c  Set "Hostname" to the name chosen in step 3
   d  Set "Address" to "10.0.2.15"
   e  Set "Router" to "10.0.2.2"
   f  Set "Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
   g  Set "Netmask" to "255.255.255.0"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.

NOTE: On NeXTstep 3.0 and later NetManager is called HostManager, "Network Type" 
      is called "NetInfo Binding" and "Non-NetInfo Network" is called "Use local 
      domain only".
      On NeXTstep 2.0 and later "Yellow Pages Domain Name" is called "NIS Domain 
      Name".


HOWTO: Open and save "/etc/hosts" using root privileges:

   a  Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and open "/etc/hosts" 
      using these commands:
         su
         open /etc/hosts
   b  Edit the file as described above.
   c  On NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2 close the file. When asked if you want to save 
      changes, confirm it. On NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2 the procedure is done and 
      you can skip step d.
   d  On NeXTstep 3.0 and later save a copy of the file to your home folder by 
      selecting File > Save As... and writing "~/hosts" to the name field. Then 
      open Terminal and copy the file to its destination using these commands:
         su
         cp ~/hosts /etc

NOTE: This procedure also works for editing "/etc/resolv.conf". Just replace 
      "/etc/hosts" with "/etc/resolv.conf". If "/etc/resolv.conf" does not exist 
      you can create it using these commands before starting with step a:
         su
         touch /etc/resolv.conf


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.9:

1. Make sure Ethernet is disconnected before the first boot. During the boot 
   process you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might be dropped to the 
   single user mode console. If prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on the 
   single user mode console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open Preferences (you find it in /NextApps directory) and go to the 
   "Password" preferences panel. Set a password for "me" (leave old password 
   field empty) and log out. You will then get the log in panel. Log in as super 
   user by entering "root" in the "name" field and leaving the password field 
   empty (press Enter twice).

3. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) and select 
   "Local Configuration...". Set "Network Type" to "Non-NeXT Network" and click 
   "Save". Confirm all messages until you are asked if you want to reboot. Skip 
   reboot.

4. Open Shell (you find it in /NextApps directory) to create, open and modify 
   some files as follows. Replace xxx in steps b and c with your preferred 
   hostname. It has to consist of a maximum of eight lower case letters.
   a  Create and modify "/etc/resolv.conf" with these commands:
         touch /etc/resolv.conf
         open /etc/resolv.conf
      Append these two lines to the file
         domain local
         nameserver 10.0.2.3
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.
   b  Modify "/etc/hostconfig" with these commands:
         open /etc/hostconfig
      Set the values as follows 
         HOSTNAME=xxx
         INETADDR=10.0.2.15
         ROUTER=-ROUTED-
         NETMASTER=-NO-
         YPDOMAIN=-NO-
         IPNETMASK=255.255.255.0
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save. If a line does not 
      already exist, just create it.
   c  Modify "/etc/hosts" with these commands:
         open /etc/hosts
      Append these two lines to the file
         10.0.2.15 xxx
         10.0.2.254 nfs
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

5. Open NetInfo (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) and go to 
   "users" > "me". Double click the field right to "passwd" containing the 
   encrypted password and delete the contents of the field. Press OK and quit 
   NetInfo.

6. Connect Ethernet and from Shell reboot using this command:
      reboot
   Done.

NOTE: If you prefer to statically configure the router you have to modify the 
      file "/etc/rc" by replacing the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 0
      with the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 1


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.8:

1. Open the file "/etc/hosts" and append the following lines to the file. In the 
   first line replace xxx with your preferred hostname. It has to consist of a 
   maximum of eight lower case letters.
      10.0.2.15 xxx
      10.0.2.254 nfs

2. Open the file "/etc/resolv.conf" and append the following two lines to the 
   file:
      domain local
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

3. Open Shell (you find it in /bootdisk/NeXT/Apps directory) and use these 
   commands to write your hostname to the disk label and reboot. Replace xxx 
   with the hostname chosen in step 1.
      su
      disk -t XT-8760S-512 -H xxx /dev/rsd0a
      touch /bootdisk/fastboot
      reboot

4. You can now do some basic networking like telnet to a specific IP address or 
   set up an NFS share. Note that resolving host names via DNS does not work.

NOTE: The /etc/rc.boot script configures the network with this command:
         ifconfig en0 10.0.2.15

      The router can be statically configured by modifying the /etc/rc.local 
      script. You need to replace the lines
         if [ -f /etc/routed ]; then
            /etc/routed &
            (echo -n ' routed') >/dev/console
         fi
      with the lines
         if [ -f /etc/route ]; then
            (/etc/route add default 10.0.2.2 1) >/dev/console
         fi
