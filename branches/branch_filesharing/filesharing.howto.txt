NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network
      interface. For this procedure to work, networking must be 
      setup first (see networking.howto.txt for details).

      If using PCAP as network interface you need to set up NFS 
      file sharing on your host system or network and replace the 
      server name (shared.local) with the name of your NFS 
      server. You might also need to create an entry with your 
      server's IP address and hostname in "/etc/hosts".


NOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2:

1. Open the file "/etc/fstab" using this command from the
   command line:
      open /etc/fstab   

2. Edit the file "/etc/fstab" by adding the shared filesystem.
   Add this line at the end of the file: 
      shared.local:/ /Net nfs rw,net 0 0

3. Load the edited file using these commands from the command
   line:
      su
      niload fstab / < /etc/fstab

4. The shared folder should be accessible from /Net directory
   after reboot.


HOWTO: Setup NFS file sharing under NeXTstep 3.0 and later:

1. Open NFSManager (you find it in the /NextAdmin directory).

2. Go to the Imported Directories window and press "Add...".

3. Set server name to "shared.local" and remote directory to "/".
   Click OK and quit NFSManager. 

4. The shared folder should immediately be accessible from /Net 
   directory.


HOWTO: Manually mount NFS shared directory:
1. Open Terminal and type these commands to the command line:
      su
      mount -o rw,net shared.local:/ /Net

2. The shared folder should immediately be accessible from /Net 
   directory.
