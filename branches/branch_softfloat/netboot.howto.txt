NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network
      interface. PCAP cannot be used for netbooting. 

      It is not possible to extract images of magneto-optical 
      disks using ditool. Netbooting NeXTstep 0.9 only works 
      using ROM 0.8 and netbooting NeXTstep 1.0 and later only 
      works using ROM 1.0 and later.


NOWTO: Setup netboot under NeXTstep 0.9 and later:

0. Before you start you need these things:
   a  ditool: This command line utility comes with Previous. It
      can extract files from raw disk images with NeXT (UFS) file
      systems. To call it you have to specify the path and name 
      of the utility and the input and output directories on the 
      command line. 
   b  image.dd: This is the raw disk image you want to extract to
      some directory. It contains a bootable NeXTstep system. To 
      extract it you have to specify the name of the image 
      including the path to it after the "-im" option when 
      calling the ditool utility.
   c  nfsdir: This is the directory you want to share with the 
      guest system via NFS. It is recommended to start with an 
      empty directory. The bootable raw disk image will be 
      extracted to this directory. During netboot it will be 
      mounted at / on the guest system. To copy the bootable 
      system to it you have to specify the path to the directory 
      after the "-out" option when calling the ditool utility.

1. Boot your raw disk image and on the guest system open Terminal 
   (you find it in /NextApps directory). Create a new client 
   using these commands from the command line:
      su
      newclient -s shared.local previous

   If your guest system is NeXTstep 0.9 first use the procedure 
   in networking.howto.txt to set up networking and then use 
   these additional commands to copy the boot and kernel files to 
   tftpboot:
      cp /sdmach /private/tftpboot/mach
      cp /usr/standalone/boot /private/tftpboot
      #cp /sdmach /clients/previous/tftpboot/mach
      #cp /usr/standalone/boot /clients/previous/tftpboot

2. Shut down the guest system and use ditool from your host
   system to extract your raw disk image to your NFS shared 
   directory using this command from the command line:
      ditool -im image.dd -out nfsdir

3. From your host system replace the file "fstab" that is located 
   in "nfsdir/private/etc" with the version of "fstab" located in
   "nfsdir/clients/previous/etc". Then open the file "hosts" that
   is located in "nfsdir/private/etc" using some text editor and 
   append the following lines to the file:
      10.0.2.15   previous
      10.0.2.254  shared.local

4. You can now netboot by setting "NFS shared directory" in the
   "Network" options to nfsdir and "Boot device" from "Boot" 
   options to "Ethernet".


Boot guest SCSI disk:
#su
#newclient -s shared.local previous

Host:
#ditool -im image.dd -out shareddir -clean
