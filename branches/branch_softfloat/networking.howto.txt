WARNING: Do not start NeXTstep 0.8 or 0.9 with Ethernet connected.
         The system hangs in the boot process. If it hangs also
         with disconnected Ethernet you can proceed by simultaneously
         pressing 'ctrl'+'c'.

NOTE:    This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as networking
         interface.


Howto: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.8 and 0.9:
   
   FIXME: No procedure yet. Make sure Ethernet is disconnected
          when booting NeXTstep 0.8 or 0.9.


Howto: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 and later:

1. On first boot you might be prompted to press 'c' or
   you might be dropped to the single user mode console. 
   If prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on the single 
   user mode console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open "/etc/resolv.conf" and add "nameserver 10.0.2.3".
   If this file does not exist, you have to first create it. 
   Be sure you create a plain text file. If you use Edit.app
   you can do this by selecting Format > Text > Make ASCII.
   You can save the file from the save dialog by typing 
   "/etc/resolv.conf" to the name field.

3. This step is only required on NeXTstep 2.0 and later:
   Open "/etc/hosts" and append the following line:
   10.0.2.15	XXX (replace XXX with your hostname, see 4c)

   Open Terminal (you find it in NextApps directory) and
   load the edited file using these commands:
   su
   niload hosts / < /etc/hosts 

4. Open NetManager (you find it in NextAdmin directory).

   Go to "Local..." and configure with these values:
   a  For "Network Type" select  "Non-NetInfo Network"
   b  For "Yellow Pages Domain Name" select "None"
   c  Choose a hostname (choose whatever you want, see step 3)
   d  Set "Address" to "10.0.2.15"
   e  Set "Router" to "10.0.2.2"
   f  Set "Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
   g  Set "Netmask" to "255.255.255.0"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.

   Note: On NeXTstep 3.0 and later NetManager is called 
         HostManager, "Network type" is called "NetInfo 
         Binding" and "Non-NetInfo Network" is called "Use 
         local domain only".
         On NeXTstep 2.0 and later "Yellow Pages Domain Name"
         is called "NIS Domain Name".


Howto: Open the above files using root privileges:

   NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2:
   a  Open Terminal (you find it in the NextApps directory)
      and open the files using these commands:
      su
      open /path/to/file (e.g. open /etc/hosts)

   NeXTstep 3.0 through 3.2:
   a  Log in as root and use the procedure for NeXTstep 1.0
      through 2.2.

   NeXTstep 3.3 and later:
   a  Open Terminal (you find it in the NextApps directory)
      and open the /etc directory using this command:
      open /etc
   b  Select the file to open and from Workspace select: 
      Services > Open Sesame > Open As Root.
   c  For making a new resolv.conf open Edit.app by selecting
      the application (you find it in the NextApps directory)
      and from Workspace select: 
      Services > Open Sesame > Open As Root.
