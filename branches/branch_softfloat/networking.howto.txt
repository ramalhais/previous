NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network
      interface. If using PCAP as network interface, you have to 
      replace the IP address and the addresses of nameserver, 
      router, broadcast and netmask with values valid on your 
      local network.


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 and later:

1. On first boot you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might 
   be dropped to the single user mode console. If prompted to 
   press 'c' just do so or if on the single user mode console 
   just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open "/etc/resolv.conf" and add "nameserver 10.0.2.3". If this 
   file does not exist, you have to first create it. Be sure you 
   create a plain text file. If you use Edit.app you can do this 
   by selecting Format > Text > Make ASCII. You can save the file 
   from the save dialog by typing "/etc/resolv.conf" to the name 
   field.

3. This step is only required on NeXTstep 2.0 and later:
   Open "/etc/hosts" and append the following line:
      10.0.2.15 XXX (replace XXX with your hostname, see 4c)

   Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and load 
   the edited file using these commands:
      su
      niload hosts / < /etc/hosts 

4. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextAdmin directory).

   Go to "Local..." and configure with these values:
   a  For "Network Type" select  "Non-NetInfo Network"
   b  For "Yellow Pages Domain Name" select "None"
   c  Choose a hostname (choose whatever you want, see step 3)
   d  Set "Address" to "10.0.2.15"
   e  Set "Router" to "10.0.2.2"
   f  Set "Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
   g  Set "Netmask" to "255.255.255.0"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.

NOTE: On NeXTstep 3.0 and later NetManager is called HostManager, 
      "Network type" is called "NetInfo Binding" and "Non-NetInfo 
      Network" is called "Use local domain only".
      On NeXTstep 2.0 and later "Yellow Pages Domain Name" is 
      called "NIS Domain Name".


HOWTO: Open and save "/etc/hosts" using root privileges:

   a  Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and 
      open "/etc/hosts" using these commands:
         su
         open /etc/hosts
   b  Edit the file as described above.
   c  On NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2 close the file. When asked if 
      you want to save changes, confirm it. On NeXTstep 1.0 
      through 2.2 the procedure is done and you can skip step d.
   d  On NeXTstep 3.0 and later save a copy of the file to your 
      home folder by selecting File > Save As... and writing
      "~/hosts" to the name field. Then open Terminal and copy 
      the file to its destination using these commands:
         su
         cp ~/hosts /etc

NOTE: This procedure also works for editing "/etc/resolv.conf". 
      Just replace "/etc/hosts" with "/etc/resolv.conf". If 
      "/etc/resolv.conf" does not exist you have to first create 
      it using these commands before starting with step a:
         su
         touch /etc/resolv.conf


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.9:

1. Make sure Ethernet is disconnected before the first boot. 
   During the boot process you might be prompted to press 'c' 
   or you might be dropped to the single user mode console. If 
   prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on the single user mode
   console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open Preferences (you find it in /NextApps directory) and go 
   to the "Password" preferences panel. Set a password for "me" 
   (leave old password field empty) and log out. You will then 
   get the log in panel. Log in as super user by entering "root" 
   in the "name" field and leaving the password field empty 
   (press Enter twice).

3. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory)
   and select "Local Configuration...". Set "Network Type" to 
   "Non-NeXT Network" and click "Save". Confirm all messages 
   until you are asked if you want to reboot. Skip reboot.

4. Open Shell (you find it in /NextApps directory) to create, 
   open and modify some files as follows:
   a  Create and modify "/etc/resolv.conf" with these commands:
         touch /etc/resolv.conf
         open /etc/resolv.conf
      Append this line to the file
         nameserver 10.0.2.3
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.
   b  Modify "/etc/hostconfig" with these commands:
         open /etc/hostconfig
      Set the values as follows 
         HOSTNAME=XXX (replace XXX with your preferred hostname)
         INETADDR=10.0.2.15
         ROUTER=10.0.2.2
         NETMASTER=-NO-
         YPDOMAIN=-NO-
         IPNETMASK=255.255.255.0
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save. If a line
      does not already exist, just create it.
   c  Modify "/etc/rc" with these commands:
         open /etc/rc
      Find the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 0
      change it to
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 1
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

5. Open NetInfo (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) 
   and open "users" > "me". Double click the field right to 
   "passwd" containing the encrypted password and delete the
   contents of the field. Press OK and quit NetInfo.

6. Connect Ethernet and from Shell reboot using this command:
      reboot
   Done.
