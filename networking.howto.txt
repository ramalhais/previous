NOTE: This procedure is only valid when using SLiRP as network
      interface. If using PCAP as network interface, you have to 
      replace your domain and address and the addresses of 
      nameserver, router, broadcast and netmask with values valid 
      on your local network. If your router does not support the 
      Routing Information Protocol version 1 you have to 
      statically configure the router address.


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 1.0 and later:

1. On first boot you might be prompted to press 'c' or you might 
   be dropped to the single user mode console. If prompted to 
   press 'c' just do so or if on the single user mode console 
   just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open "/etc/resolv.conf" and add these two lines to the file:
      domain local
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

   If the file does not exist, you have to first create it. Make 
   sure you create a plain text file. If you use Edit.app you can 
   do this by selecting Format > Text > Make ASCII. You can save 
   the file from the save dialog by typing "/etc/resolv.conf" to 
   the name field.

3. Open "/etc/hosts" and append the following lines. In the first 
   line replace xxx with your preferred hostname. It has to 
   consist of a maximum of eight lower case letters.
      10.0.2.15 xxx
      10.0.2.254 shared.local

   Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and load 
   the edited file using these commands:
      su
      niload hosts / < /etc/hosts 

4. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextAdmin directory).

   Go to "Local..." and configure with these values:
   a  For "Network Type" select  "Non-NetInfo Network"
   b  For "Yellow Pages Domain Name" select "None"
   c  Set "Hostname" to the name chosen in step 3
   d  Set "Address" to "10.0.2.15"
   e  Set "Router" to "10.0.2.2"
   f  Set "Broadcast Address to "10.0.2.255"
   g  Set "Netmask" to "255.255.255.0"
   h  Hit "OK" and confirm all messages. It will reboot. Done.

NOTE: On NeXTstep 3.0 and later NetManager is called HostManager, 
      "Network Type" is called "NetInfo Binding" and "Non-NetInfo 
      Network" is called "Use local domain only".
      On NeXTstep 2.0 and later "Yellow Pages Domain Name" is 
      called "NIS Domain Name".


HOWTO: Open and save "/etc/hosts" using root privileges:

   a  Open Terminal (you find it in /NextApps directory) and 
      open "/etc/hosts" using these commands:
         su
         open /etc/hosts
   b  Edit the file as described above.
   c  On NeXTstep 1.0 through 2.2 close the file. When asked if 
      you want to save changes, confirm it. On NeXTstep 1.0 
      through 2.2 the procedure is done and you can skip step d.
   d  On NeXTstep 3.0 and later save a copy of the file to your 
      home folder by selecting File > Save As... and writing
      "~/hosts" to the name field. Then open Terminal and copy 
      the file to its destination using these commands:
         su
         cp ~/hosts /etc

NOTE: This procedure also works for editing "/etc/resolv.conf". 
      Just replace "/etc/hosts" with "/etc/resolv.conf". If 
      "/etc/resolv.conf" does not exist you have to first create 
      it using these commands before starting with step a:
         su
         touch /etc/resolv.conf


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.9:

1. Make sure Ethernet is disconnected before the first boot. 
   During the boot process you might be prompted to press 'c' 
   or you might be dropped to the single user mode console. If 
   prompted to press 'c' just do so or if on the single user mode
   console just type "exit" to continue booting.

2. Open Preferences (you find it in /NextApps directory) and go 
   to the "Password" preferences panel. Set a password for "me" 
   (leave old password field empty) and log out. You will then 
   get the log in panel. Log in as super user by entering "root" 
   in the "name" field and leaving the password field empty 
   (press Enter twice).

3. Open NetManager (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory)
   and select "Local Configuration...". Set "Network Type" to 
   "Non-NeXT Network" and click "Save". Confirm all messages 
   until you are asked if you want to reboot. Skip reboot.

4. Open Shell (you find it in /NextApps directory) to create, 
   open and modify some files as follows. Replace xxx in steps b 
   and c with your preferred hostname. It has to consist of a 
   maximum of eight lower case letters.
   a  Create and modify "/etc/resolv.conf" with these commands:
         touch /etc/resolv.conf
         open /etc/resolv.conf
      Append these two lines to the file
         domain local
         nameserver 10.0.2.3
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.
   b  Modify "/etc/hostconfig" with these commands:
         open /etc/hostconfig
      Set the values as follows 
         HOSTNAME=xxx
         INETADDR=10.0.2.15
         ROUTER=-ROUTED-
         NETMASTER=-NO-
         YPDOMAIN=-NO-
         IPNETMASK=255.255.255.0
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save. If a line
      does not already exist, just create it.
   c  Modify "/etc/hosts" with these commands:
         open /etc/hosts
      Append these two lines to the file
         10.0.2.15 xxx
         10.0.2.254 shared.local
      and save the changes by selecting Window > Save.

5. Open NetInfo (you find it in /NextDeveloper/Apps directory) 
   and open "users" > "me". Double click the field right to 
   "passwd" containing the encrypted password and delete the
   contents of the field. Press OK and quit NetInfo.

6. Connect Ethernet and from Shell reboot using this command:
      reboot
   Done.

NOTE: If you prefer to statically configure the router you have 
      to modify the file "/etc/rc" by replacing the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 0
      with the term
         /usr/etc/route add default $ROUTER 1


NOWTO: Setup networking on NeXTstep 0.8:

1. Open the file "/etc/hosts" and append the following lines to
   the file. In the first line replace xxx with your preferred
   hostname. It has to consist of a maximum of eight lower case 
   letters.
      10.0.2.15 xxx
      10.0.2.254 shared.local

2. Open the file "/etc/resolv.conf" and append the following two
   lines to the file:
      domain local
      nameserver 10.0.2.3

3. Open Shell (you find it in /bootdisk/NeXT/Apps directory) and 
   use these commands to write your hostname to the disk label
   and reboot. Replace xxx with the hostname chosen in step 1.
      su
      disk -t XT-8760S-512 -H xxx /dev/rsd0a
      touch /bootdisk/fastboot
      reboot

4. You can now do some basic networking like telnet to a specific
   IP address or set up an NFS share. Note that resolving host 
   names via DNS does not work.

NOTE: The /etc/rc.boot script configures the network with this 
      command:
         ifconfig en0 10.0.2.15

      The router can be statically configured by modifying the 
      /etc/rc.local script. You need to replace the lines
         if [ -f /etc/routed ]; then
            /etc/routed &
            (echo -n ' routed') >/dev/console
         fi
      with the lines
         if [ -f /etc/route ]; then
            (/etc/route add default 10.0.2.2 1) >/dev/console
         fi
